# SimpleDice
 A Kotlin-based dice-rolling app that stores all data locally.
 
### Description
A Kotlin-based dice-rolling app that stores all data locally.  Allows users to see the results for any number of dice, and save favorite dice sets locally via SQLite database.  Also keeps a local record of all recent dice results.

Conversion of Capstone Project.  See that project for more details.

### What I accomplished in this project:

* Converted a project entirely from Java to Kotlin, and updated to use AndroidX.
* Refactored an existing project to use local database storage instead of cloud storage.
* Polished a project to take it from being a functional app, to a release ready product.
* Implemented animations, card views, and colors in a meaningful way to respect Material Design.
* Utilized Material Design to create visual clarity in the user experience.
* Added settings to allow the user to personalize their experience.
* Tested from KitKat to Oreo to ensure a functioning, visually-sound product.
